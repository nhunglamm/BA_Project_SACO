Business Analysis project for SACO IT SME - BA Intern application

## Overview
This project analyzes the information systems of SACO, a small IT SME in Ho Chi Minh City, using SWOT analysis to identify gaps and proposes two solutions (Zoho One and Microsoft Integration) to drive digital transformation, reduce costs, and enhance scalability.

## Objectives
Analyze SACO’s systems (CRM, ERP, AIS, HRM, TPS, MIS) to identify strengths and weaknesses.
Propose solutions to optimize operations, improve security, and support market expansion.
Recommend Zoho One as the optimal choice for SACO’s SME needs.

## Key Findings
